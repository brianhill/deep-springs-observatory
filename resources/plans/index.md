### Control Room Plans

Various web resources, especially this one on [framing basics](https://theinspiringinvestment.com/diy-framing-basics/), are essential
if this is your first building project.

After drawing every wall, including the cripple walls that support the shed roof,
we had an estimate of the materials needs and made the following order:

* [Control Room Lumber Order](./ControlRoomLumber.pdf)

The materials needs were padded by 20&percent; to account for warped or damaged lumber
and for framing errors. In fact, although the lumber was green and a little warped so much that it was unusable, it was of high quality. Also, we made very few mistakes and ended up with considerable surplus. The exception to this was that we used every rafter and had to do an additional lumber run for pressure-treated fascia.
