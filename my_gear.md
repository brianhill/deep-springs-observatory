### CFF 250mm Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien

The dome is versatile enough to house other instruments. The Natural Science Chair's CFF 250mm f/8 Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien reflector will often be put to use:

The CFF RC250 is carried by a Software Bisque [Paramount MYT](https://www.bisque.com/product/paramount-myt-portable-robotic-telescope-mount/):

### Stellarvue 130mm Apochromat

Finally, students will gain experience using a Stellarvue SVA130T f/7 triplet apochromat refractor:

The SVA130T is the predecessor of the Stellarvue [SVX130T](https://www.stellarvue.com/svx130t/). For scientific and astrophotography uses, the SVA130T is paired with a Stellarvue [SFFRR.72 Reducer/Flattener](./photos/SFFR72-130.jpg), resulting in an f/5 effective focal ratio.

The SVA130T is carried by a Losmandy GM811G:

A Losmandy [HD tripod](http://store.losmandy.com/fhd-ma) supports the GM811G, and the scope, mount, and tripod are portable enough to be taken to exceptional nearby sites such as the White Mountain Research Center [Barcroft Station](https://www.wmrc.edu/facilities/bar/default.html).

## Power

Field power for the telescopes and their associated electronics is provided by a Jackery [Explorer 1000](https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-1000-portable-power-station).
