# Deep Springs Observatory

## Site

The observatory foundation is under construction and the observatory is expected to be at least partially operable in Spring 2021:

The foundation will secure and support an Aphelion (previously branded as Galactica) 7' clamshell dome:

The dome is shown with [the author](../) inside. It will remain stored on cinder blocks and a pallet until the foundation is complete.

## Primary Instrument

The 7' diameter dome is just large enough to protect a CFF 250mm f/8 Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien reflector:

The 250mm will ride on a Paramount MYT:

A Software Bisque [pier](https://www.bisque.com/product/mx-pier/) will be set in the center of the dome after the perimeter foundation is completed.

## Portable Instrument

Students gain experience using a Stellarvue 130mm f/7 triplet apochromat refractor:

The 130mm rides on a Losmandy GM811G:

A Losmandy [HD tripod](http://store.losmandy.com/fhd-ma) supports the GM811G, and the scope, mount, and tripod are reasonably portable.

## Power

Field power for both the 250 and the 130 is provided by a Jackery [Explorer 1000](https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-1000-portable-power-station).
