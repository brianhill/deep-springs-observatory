The foundation will secure and support an Aphelion (previously branded as Galactica) 7' clamshell dome:

The dome is shown with [the author](../) inside. It will remain stored on bricks and a pallet until the foundation is complete.

## Instrument

The dome was chosen to protect a CFF 250mm f/8 Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien reflector:

The 250mm will ride on a Paramount MYT:

A Software Bisque [pier](https://www.bisque.com/product/mx-pier/) will be set in the center of the dome after the perimeter foundation is completed.

## Portable Instrument

Students gain experience using a Stellarvue 130mm f/7 triplet apochromat refractor:

The 130mm rides on a Losmandy GM811G:

The Stellarvue 130mm and the Losmandy GM811G are set up on a Losmandy HD tripod and the combination is readily portable.
