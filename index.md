# Deep Springs Observatory

*The construction of the Deep Springs observatory is being made possible by the enthusiasm and generosity of the Deep Springs Class of '77.*

## Dome and Control Room

The control room for the observatory is on track to be usable (but not finished out) in time for the beginning of Term 5 (March 14, 2022) when the first observational astronomy course
utilizing the observatory will begin. Below is Polaris (top center) and the rest of Ursa Minor stretching to the right over the moonlit rafters of the control room:

The rafter pitch is set to the 7-24-25 [Pythagorean triple](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanTriple.html), more commonly known to builders as 3&frac12;:12 pitch.

The observatory's dome is the [Aphelion 7 ft Model](https://www.apheliondomes.com/products.html) purchased used from [Antelope Hills Observatory](http://www.antelopehillsobservatory.org). The  usable height inside has been increased to 81&frac12;&rdquo; by bolting the dome to a 24-sided sill plate, which is itself secured with 48 wedge anchors to a 12-sided concrete riser.

## Instrument

Saint Mary's College donated one of its classic [Meade LX200 EMC 10&rdquo;](./resources/LX200_Classic_Manual.pdf) telescopes to Deep Springs College:

The telescope's optical tube assembly (OTA) was de-forked and modified to ride on a [Losmandy G11G](http://www.losmandy.com/g-11.html):

## Visual Use

For visual use, the Meade Series 4000 Super-Wide-Angle 2&rdquo; eyepiece (having an apparent field of view of 67&deg;) the telescope will take in a full 1&deg; of the sky at 63.5x power.

## Imaging

For astrophotography, a [ZWO ASI2600MC Pro](https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi2600mc-pro-color) CMOS camera that was briefly used for SETI searches has been donated by Space Laser Awareness. It will be paired with a Celestron Reducer/Flattener creating an effective focal ratio of f/6.3.

The SONY IMX571 sensor in the ASI2600MC Pro has a pixel pitch of 3.76 microns and an image area of 23.5x17.5mm. With an effective focal length of 2540mm\*0.63=1600mm the image scale is 1600\*2&pi;/360/60=0.465mm/&rsquo; or 7.76 microns/&rdquo; or 0.4847 &rdquo;/pixel. With a resolution of 6248x4176 pixels the image area is 50.5x33.7&rsquo;.

Thanks to the very substantial value to the observatory of the OTA and the CMOS camera, there is budget to select additional equipment that will round out both the visual and imaging capabilities.

## Power

Field power for the telescope, its camera, and the computers that control them will be provided by two [Jackery Explorer 1000s](https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-1000-portable-power-station) which will be kept charged by two [SolarSaga 100 panels](https://www.jackery.com/products/solarsaga-100w-solar-panel). Industrial grade PVC conduit for carrying data and power is routed underground between the dome and the control room.

## Program

With the clear, dark skies and high elevation at Deep springs and the modern CMOS camera, students will be able to use the dome, telescope, and control room to do a wide variety of pedagogically and scientifically valuable projects.
