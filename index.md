# Deep Springs Observatory

The construction of the Deep Springs observatory &mdash; is being made possible by the enthusiasm and generosity of the Deep Springs Class of '77.

## Dome

Construction of a foundation for the dome is underway and the observatory is expected to be at least partially operable in May of 2021:

The foundation will secure and support an Aphelion [7 ft clamshell dome](https://www.apheliondomes.com/products.html) purchased used from Antelope Hills Observatory in Bennett, Colorado.

## Instruments

### 11&rdquo; Celestron Edge HD Schmidt Astrograph

The dome will house an 11&rdquo; Celestron Edge HD refractor.

The Edge HD reflector will be carried by a Losmandy G11T.

### CFF 250mm Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien

The dome is versatile enough to house other instruments. The Natural Science Chair's CFF 250mm f/8 Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien reflector will often be put to use:

The CFF RC250 is carried by a Software Bisque [Paramount MYT](https://www.bisque.com/product/paramount-myt-portable-robotic-telescope-mount/):

### Stellarvue 130mm Apochromat

Finally, students will gain experience using a Stellarvue SVA130T f/7 triplet apochromat refractor:

The SVA130T is the predecessor of the Stellarvue [SVX130T](https://www.stellarvue.com/svx130t/). For scientific and astrophotography uses, the SVA130T is paired with a Stellarvue [SFFRR.72 Reducer/Flattener](./photos/SFFR72-130.jpg), resulting in an f/5 effective focal ratio.

The SVA130T is carried by a Losmandy GM811G:

A Losmandy [HD tripod](http://store.losmandy.com/fhd-ma) supports the GM811G, and the scope, mount, and tripod are portable enough to be taken to exceptional nearby sites such as the White Mountain Research Center [Barcroft Station](https://www.wmrc.edu/facilities/bar/default.html).

## Power

Field power for the telescopes and their associated electronics is provided by a Jackery [Explorer 1000](https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-1000-portable-power-station).
